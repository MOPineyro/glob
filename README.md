##How To Install (as Custom Script)

1. Open any Google Doc.
2. Under the `Tools` menu item, select `Script Editor`. (This will open a new tab/window)
3. In the new window, select `Create Script for Blank Project`.
4. This should create a new `code.gs` file. Delete its contents and replace with them with the included `code.gs` file.
5. Create a new HTML file called 'Sidebar' for this Google script. (`File` > `New` > `Html file`)
6. Delete the initial contents of the file and replace them with the included `Sidebar.html`.
